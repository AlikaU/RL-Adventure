# A Categorical DRL experiment
This is a fork of [higgsfield's implementation](https://github.com/higgsfield/RL-Adventure) of ['A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06887.pdf) by M. Bellemare et al.

# Goals
To test the convergence of a C51 algorithm modification, where the KL divergence update rule is replaced by a total variation distance update rule.

# Pre-requisites
Pytorch 0.2
Gym 0.7.4

# Notes
Doesn't work with more recent versions of Pytorch and Gym for me.
This setup is unstable and often gives warnings/errors.
